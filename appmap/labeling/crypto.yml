# Labels for cryptography.
#
# This file is by no means complete.
# There are several competing crypto libraries for python,
# and specific functions are often implementation details
# exposed through abstract interfaces, which makes it
# difficult and brittle to fully enumerate.
# For this reason, the attempt was to only list the most
# commonly used functions from built-in libraries,
# pycrypto(dome) and cryptography.
# Please open an issue or a pull request if there's any
# commonly used function missing from here.
